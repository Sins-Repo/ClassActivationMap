# Class Activation Map
Have you ever wondered what a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) considered while making predictions? <br/>
You can visualize it with class activation map. A heatmap of *'Class Activation'* is generated over the input image to look for specific features, features that may influence the final prediction of the model.
